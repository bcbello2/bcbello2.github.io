Hey Guys!
So I finished the home page and contact page  and made a frame for all of the pages.
I also somehow managed to get slicknav to work and I applied the necessary code for it to work on all pages.
You guys can decide which pages to do buy you should be able to just put content in the main div on each page.
I have no idea how to position the buttons correctly on the home page on the main picture (find a dog/find a cat) so I commented them out but if either of you know how to put the 
buttons on the picture please tell me and I will do it.
I also do not know how to make a slide show for the pet profiles so I just put four of them.
I added media queries to make a mobile view for my pages but you guys will have to do your own media queries for your respective pages.  
To view the page in mobile view just shorten the width of the browser until the slicknav menu appears then stop.
Let me know if you guys have questions or need any help!
